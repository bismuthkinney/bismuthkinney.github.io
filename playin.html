The Play-In Tournament: Redefining "making the playoffs"
</h1>

In the '75-'76 NBA season, the LA Lakers had just traded for Kareem, who then won the MVP and carried the team to a 40-42 season, the 4th best in the conference. But due to dumb rules about awarding playoff spots to the best teams in each division, the Lakers were not one of the 5 teams to qualify for the postseason, and so the narratives were born: “Kareem was traded to the Lakers and promptly missed the playoffs” and “Kareem won the MVP despite missing the playoffs”. Now these weird rules have since been adjusted, but there’s a new development that stands to change what “making the playoffs” means: the play-in tournament. 
<br>
<br>
If you have no clue how the play-in tournament works, click

here.

The diagram on this page explains it far better than I ever could. 
<br>
<br>
Now there’s one big benefit to the play-in tournament which I want to get out of the way, and it mainly applies to teams that are rebuilding / teams with young players. Having something to aim for even if you can’t quite crack the top 8 is probably good for team culture and player development. Plus, chasing for a play-in spot + the play-in games themselves are a decent approximation of playoff intensity that would benefit a young, inexperienced team.
<br>
<br>
But for established teams with established stars, the implications are much... I’ll say more complicated, mainly with regards to players' legacies. Let’s say the Warriors finish 9th and the Blazers finish 8th (just for argument’s sake), and the Warriors end up beating the Blazers for the playoff 8th seed. Now arguments about their legacy could go both ways. In the moment, there are going to be a lot of people arguing that “Curry can’t carry, he needed a play-in game just to get to the playoffs”. And in 10 years, context will fade, and we’ll criticize Dame for missing the playoffs, no matter how much criticism he actually deserves for it. 
<br>
<br>
In some circumstances, these might be moot points: if Curry clearly outplayed Dame in the play-in game, we’d remember that; if the Warriors were within a game of the Blazers in the regular season, we might cut them some slack. But if a team that clearly would have been outside the playoff picture now gets a chance with the play-in games, now those 1-2 games can rewrite legacies, and that thought is scary. I can’t definitively say that’s a bad thing, but I’m leaning towards that side, because it devalues the whole regular season. 
<br>
<br>
I’m hoping the play-in games aren’t here to stay. It feels exciting simply because it’s different, and not because it enhances the regular season or the overall NBA in a significant way. But I understand that others may disagree, and we’ll just have to see. If it is here to stay though, it may drastically change what it means to “make the playoffs”, especially as the years go by and context fades.
