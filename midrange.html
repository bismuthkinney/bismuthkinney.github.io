Situational Awareness & Adaptability: My thoughts on the midrange shot
</h1>
<p style="font-size:14px;text-align:left;">

I’m going to state a claim that is analytically true: the midrange jumper is the worst, least efficient shot in basketball. You’ve heard this before, no doubt, and you probably have a strong opinion on it. But here, I want to have a more nuanced discussion on when this statement should and shouldn’t be applied.
<br>
<br>
Over the course of a season, this is absolutely true. It’s why the Houston Rockets have put up some of the greatest offensive seasons in the history of basketball. Over a large sample size, if you consider an optimization function which balances shot accuracy/difficulty with point reward, you will end up with the Rocket’s game plan of “3s or layups”. 
<br>
<br>
But the key word there is “large sample size”. This is a big problem with NBA statistics that I have somewhat touched on in a previous post. When you try to take analyses that work over a large sample size (a regular season or a career) and try to apply them to a game or a playoff series, they just fall apart. There are two main reasons for this:
<br>
<br>
The first is just a fact of statistics, the standard error decreases with increased sample size, so I can be more confident that my results won't deviate too far from an average / expected value. If I flip 1000 coins, I can count on getting about 500 heads and 500 tails with a decent level of confidence. But would I place any bets on 2 or 4 or even 10 flips being 50:50? Absolutely not. 
<br>
<br>
The second is that basketball isn’t that simple to break down into probabilities. Steph Curry doesn’t shoot 43% from 3 every game, because it’s obviously just not that simple. Some nights they play great defensive teams or he’s going through a slump. Other nights he has the hot hand or he’s playing the Pistons. It’s not like there’s some predictable random number generator deciding whether a shot is going to go in, there are so many other intangible variables involved.
<br>
<br>
The main variable is how the defense is playing you, which is why having an adaptable offense is much more important than one that is more efficient on paper. If your MO the whole year is “3s and layups”, then teams are gonna block off the paint and/or force you off the three point line. Your statistical analysis may say that the 3 point shot is better if it goes it about 35% of the time, but you can’t guarantee that you’ll hit 35% of your 3s under duress, great perimeter defense, and/or potentially sweaty palms and tired legs. If a team is going to drive you off the 3 point line, you should be taking advantage of that to find midrange opportunities that are simply more reliable shots. 
<br>
<br>
I can sum this all up with a quote we've surely all heard before: "The best shot is the one that the defense gives you".
