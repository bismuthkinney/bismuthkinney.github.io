<img src="players/kd.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant" style="width:120px;height:180px;margin:25px 75px;">
</p>

<p>
<u>1. Kevin Durant</u>
<br>
<br>
Somehow it feels like an uphill battle to argue that KD is the best player in the league, given Giannis's impressive finals and the ensuing hype surrounding him. And it's certainly close. A few months ago I would have scoffed at that notion, but Giannis has put himself in the conversation. It's just not enough yet for me to push him past KD.
<br>
<br>
KD is the best scorer in the league, simply given how much he has in his bag and how effortlessly he can get his shot off with his height. There's an argument for Curry as the league's best offensive player, but KD's height and the damage he can do in the post as a result puts him over the top. His defense isn't quite as great as it was at times in Golden State, given the injury, but he is still a solid rim protector. And for me, the combination of elite offense and solid defense is enough for the number 1 spot.

<img src="players/giannis.jpg" alt="Giannis Antetokounmpo" style="width:120px;height:180px;margin:25px 75px;">
</p>

<p>
<u>2. Giannis Antetokounmpo</u>
<br>
<br>
Like I said above, it's certainly close. I tend to see Giannis as sort of the inverse of KD: elite defense with solid offense. The elite defense took center stage in the finals, and I realized that I had overlooked it quite a bit. There's no doubt in my mind that Giannis is the best, most versatile defender in the league: with his length, lateral quickness, and bounce, he's a solid perimeter defender and lethal in the paint.
<br>
<br>
Offensively... I know he put up an all time great series with one of the greatest performances ever to close out the series. But I need to see it more consistently. He showed flashes with floaters in the paint, stretches of great free throw shooting, and cutting down on the unnecessary 3s. And seeing him work as the roll man in the PnR was a revelation, props to Coach Bud for going to that more and more as the playoffs went on. But I want to see more of it. More refinements in Giannis's post game. More consistent free throw shooting. Until then, his elite defense isn't enough for me to push him over the top.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="players/steph.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry" style="width:120px;height:180px;margin:25px 75px;">
</p>

<p>
<u>3. Stephen Curry</u>
<br>
<br>
Curry surprised even me last season. I thought he would finish around 28 ppg, but he exploded late in the season and won the scoring title, despite the defenses being thrown at him and all of the injuries to their lineup. That being said, a lot of what I have said previously about Curry still applies: he's a tough shot maker and incredible playmaker (underrated passer + insane off-ball movement), but his height is a limiting factor. He moves up to the 3rd spot simply because a couple of players previously above him fell down. So it's very possible, and in fact probable, that he ends up around 4-5 when the season ends. But if he can build on what he put together last season, I see no reason anyone should question his status as a top 5 player in the league.
</p>
<hr noshade>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="players/kawhi.jpg" alt="Kawhi Leonard" style="width:120px;height:180px;margin:25px 75px;">
</p>

<p>
<u>4. Kawhi Leonard</u>
<br>
<br>
I honestly had no idea where to put Kawhi. The Clippers playoff run was quite weird last season: I went from doubting Kawhi as an offensive centerpiece to calling him an elite midrange scorer in just one game. Defensively it was the same story: sometimes I would question whether Kawhi had just fallen off as a defender, others he showed he could still contend for a DPOY if he committed to it. 
<br>
<br>
So with all of that said, he's at the #4 spot for me. He's not the best at anything: Curry and KD I trust more offensively, and Giannis is definitely a better defender. But he's one of the most versatile players in the league. Outside of his still just average playmaking ability, there's nothing he's not great at. Of course, he will be out for a while with his injury, so I have no clue where he'll end up next time I update this list. But for now, #4 seems right.
</p>
<hr noshade>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="players/lbj.jpg" alt="Lebron James" style="width:120px;height:180px;margin:25px 75px;">
</p>

<p>
<u>5. Lebron James</u>
<br>
<br>
I very nearly avoided putting Lebron on this list, because it's not clear which Lebron I'm rating here. If it's the Lebron from the last 3 games of the Suns series, then he's certainly not top 5. His injury clearly impacted his driving ability, to the point where he just didn't even go for it as much. And defensively, he didn't look like the same Lebron from the 2020 playoffs, and certainly not close to the elite defense of '13 James. In those 3 games, I saw hardly any impact from Lebron as the Lakers just rolled over and died.
<br>
<br>
But Lebron is still the best passer in the league, unquestionably. And if he's healthy, he's the best driver in the league. That combination alone would normally be enough for Lebron to contend for best player in the league, though I'd need to see great defense from him as well to give him that title.
<br>
<br>
So with that rambling done, Lebron sits at 5, kind of as a formality really. If he's back to fully healthy, he could shoot up to 1-2. If Father Time/injuries take over completely, he could exit the list. I'm expecting something in the middle; he'll probably end up right here in this #5 spot when the season ends.=

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="players/harden.jpg" alt="James Harden" style="width:120px;height:180px;margin:25px 75px;">
</p>

<p>
<u>6. James Harden</u>
<br>
<br>
James Harden is a top-5 caliber player, but I had to make a concession somewhere and I couldn't bring myself to take another of the other guys out. So James Harden sits at #6. In my opinion, he was playing his best basketball in Brooklyn until he got injured, and he's clearly shown he's an elite playmaker and iso scorer. 
<br>
<br>
Harden is another player I hesitated to add to this list though, because I have no clue what he'll look like post-injury. He struggled when he came back in the Bucks series, and I hope that he can return to what he looked like against Boston. He has a chance to climb up this list, I just need to see what he can do this season.
</p>
<hr noshade>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="players/lillard.jpg" alt="Damian Lillard" style="width:120px;height:180px;margin:25px 75px;">
</p>

<p>
<u>7. Damian Lillard</u>
<br>
<br>
I feel mostly the same about Lillard as I have in the past; he's just a cut below Curry and Harden because I don't consider his shooting (efficiency-wise) or his passing to be as elite as those guys. But in the last 4 minutes of the ball-game, Dame's lack of hesitance to iso and drop stepback threes makes him elite, and we saw a bit of that in these past playoffs, even though they lost. As such, I'm placing him just below Harden. And there is certainly potential for him to move up this list, if we see him grow as a passer and off-ball threat in Billup's offense. I honestly think Dame is going to win the MVP this season and could move into the top 5, but I do need to see it first before I put him there. 
</p>
<hr noshade>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="players/luka.jpg" alt="Luka Doncic" style="width:120px;height:180px;margin:25px 75px;">
</p>

<p>
<u>8. Luka Doncic</u>
<br>
<br>

I think most people would put Doncic over Harden and Lillard, maybe even over an unhealthy Lebron. He did have some stellar moments in the playoffs as he convinced us that he could slay the Clippers this year around, but unfortunately it wasn't so. And as much as his passing and craftiness when getting to the basket impresses me, I'm not at all sold on him as a shooter. I will happily leave him out at the three point line; there were times where he did make the Clippers pay from there, but I don't count on that happening a lot. Luka as a shooter is just alright, and without great shooting, I can't put him above 3 guards with some of the best shooting skills ever. Even though he is the definitely the best passer of the bunch, the other 3 make up for it with their sheer gravity.

</p>
<hr noshade>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="players/jokic.jpg" alt="Nikola Jokic" style="width:120px;height:180px;margin:25px 75px;">
</p>

<p>
<u>9. Nikola Jokic</u>
<br>
<br>
I know, I know. I'm disrespecting the MVP by putting him 9th on the list. But as much as he was really impressive without Murray, I still have a lot of the same concerns with what he can bring to a playoff team as a slow big man. I've said it before: it mostly comes down to average ball-handling skills on offense and poor defense. There are a lot of really great players above that I just can't justify putting Jokic over; Luka is the only one I'd even consider moving under him. He has a really high IQ and you can build a great system around him, but he cannot take over offensively like others on this list can, and his defensive ability leaves a lot to be desired.
</p>
<hr noshade>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="players/embiid.jpg" alt="Joel Embiid" style="width:120px;height:180px;margin:25px 75px;">
</p>

<p>
<u>10. Joel Embiid</u>
<br>
<br>
Embiid is a far better defender than Jokic, but offensively, his game doesn't touch Jokic's. His stature gives him a edge backing down bigs in the post, but he's not as good a finisher, not as good a shooter, not as good with shot selection, and nowhere near the passer Jokic is. Great defense and good post scoring are enough to get Joel on the top 10 list, but certainly not enough to pass anyone above him. And if you told me you'd take Tatum or PG over Embiid, I wouldn't really challenge that. I'm interested in seeing how Embiid adapts to the mess in Philly this season, but he's clinging onto the end of this list for dear life. 
</p>

<p>
<u>Notable Exclusion: Anthony Davis</u>
<br>
<br>
I excluded AD last time I made this list, and I'm excluding him again. I still haven't seen a large sample size of healthy AD since the 2020 playoffs. He has top 5 potential, but he's going to have to put together an impressive season to vault over the players lower on this list. When last healthy he was definitely top 5, so we'll just have to see if that AD makes a return this season.
