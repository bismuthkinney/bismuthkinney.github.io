Albums are generally about one’s beliefs or experiences, and generally draw from an artist’s life. In this sense, albums generally live in the past or the present, but almost never in the future. Yet that’s what Bowie does here, foreseeing his eventual passing, Bowie writes songs as a dead man, for an audience that will shortly learn he has struggled with cancer and passed away. Not every song here takes this approach, as “‘Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” and “Sue (Or In a Season of Crime)” seem much more abstract and retrospective, and “Girl Loves Me”, “Dollar Days”, and “I Can’t Give Everything Away” are rooted in the present, depicting a man staring death right in the face and reflecting on what this means for his personal life and his legacy. But the two most notable tracks off of this album, “Blackstar” and “Lazarus”, are written and performed by a man already in heaven. While every track on this album features incredible production, captivating lyrics, and frail vocal performances which capture Bowie's plight perfectly, "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" exemplify these traits and really put this album over the top. 
<br>
<br>
“Lazarus”: This is the only song that has ever made me cry, and not just once, repeatedly. I haven’t listened to this album in its entirety in months, and it’s because of this song. The line “Look up here, I’m in heaven” gets me every single time. The bluntness of the lyrics along with the vocal performance make this one of the most powerful moments of Bowie’s career. While Bowie may not have the vocal chops of his young self at 69, the frailty and struggle in his voice works to this album’s benefit. Every vocal performance on this album, especially this one, captures Bowie’s helplessness and the eventual acceptance of the inevitability of death.
<br>
<br>
“Blackstar”: The title track, the grand spectacle, and maybe the most daring and challenging moment in a career filled with daring and challenging moments. The first thing to mention here, and that I have unfortunately not yet mentioned for the rest of the album, is the instrumentation. Even in his waning moments, Bowie still continues to keep pushing forward artistically and bringing new sounds to the forefront of his music. The main addition here, and across the album, is the use of horns. I’m usually not the biggest fan of horns, but they’re used really effectively throughout this album to add tension and unease in the right spots, and generally supplement the rest of the instrumentation well to make the album feel like an absolute spectacle. This is especially embodied in how this track is structured, the first section very much sees Bowie depicting a grim scene where everyone must surround him and watch him slowly melt away until his flame eventually goes out. The vocals add to the grim, haunted atmosphere these lyrics evoke, and draw the listener in even more. It feels as if Bowie wants you to watch him die, and despite how the idea of this tears me apart, you can’t help but remain captivated. Bowie has turned his death into a show, and he’s well aware everyone is watching. 
<br>
<br>
The transition then sees Bowie ascend to heaven with a clear change in the vocal tone and atmosphere of the track. The track just swells to an almost happy place, before the instrumentation and atmosphere from the first half slowly finds its way back in. And then comes the titular lyrics, “I’m a blackstar”. Bowie’s life is complete, and yet he is aware that he is still the spectacle here. He knows he’s ascended past the plane of our existence, he can no longer be described by any of the concepts we typically apply to our stars, he can only be likened to a dying star, light years from our planet and still not fully understood and explored by our scientists. Yet, his death, combined with his fame, has brought him to this unimaginable point. And he knows this, he understands the spectacle that he will become once he passes, and he almost seems to revel in it. Towards the end, the track slowly dies down, until the dying star eventually fades out of existence. The instrumental section here captures this perfectly, I love the way this is drawn out over the final minute, making for an incredibly emotional experience.

And this brings me to the cover art, depicting a black star with star fragments below sort of spelling out Bowie. This cover is among my favorite all time, and perfectly captures the general theme of the album and title track, with a bit of context. Every Bowie album that preceded this one has a clear cut face to it, depicted on the cover (The Next Day is kind of an exception, but the “Heroes” cover is still underneath so I’m counting it). Generally this is just Bowie, though there may be an exception or two (I think the 1. Outside cover is Bowie, but I’m not going to claim it is). But in any case, there is a character at the centerpiece of that album, whether that’s manufactured, or just another side of Bowie himself. In Blackstar, the blackstar is Bowie. Bowie is no longer human, no longer mortal, and can no longer be depicted with a face. Bowie has ascended to become a blackstar, an unfathomable, astronomical phenomenon. And yet Bowie fathomed it, and embraces it across the album. Absolutely stellar. 
<br>
<br>
All in all, this is an incredible album, and my personal pick for the best album of the 2010s. It's certainly one of the most unique albums an artist has ever made, whether it be because of the gradiose spectacle painted by the lavish, horn-filled production; the frailty and vulnerability in Bowie's vocal performances, or the lyrics staring death in the face and looking down from heaven. There’s not a single moment on this album that’s short of great, this presents some of the most emotionally powerful material I’ve ever heard on any record. It’s really hard to imagine a record better than this.
