Hi! I guess you know who I am now, so much for keeping that secret hidden. Well if you're here, you likely already knew who I was. That or you dug through my Github repository and found this, in which case, props to you.

This page is mostly insurance, to prove that I'm the one who made this website and wrote these posts. I guess I can't have both anonymity and credit, can I?
