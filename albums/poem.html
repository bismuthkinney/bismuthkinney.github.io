<br>
All along you've held a home, that dome perched on your neck
<br>
Amorphous folds to furnish, fill them to your heart's content
<br>
Set sights on shores all over, though you won't mend every wreck
<br>
Heroes can't command results, their strength's in their intent
<br>
If the murals lined across your walls are up to code
<br>
Sit back trusting all is sparkling gold within your reach
<br>
Hold your head up high, knowing you've pleased all those at home
<br>
<br>
Proudly sing this last address, from last address
<br>
<br>
