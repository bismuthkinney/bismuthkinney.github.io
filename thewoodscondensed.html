I think this is one of the best albums anyone has ever made, and that anyone could ever make; there’s only a handful of albums I think are on par with this. Despite how brilliant much of the rest of Sleater-Kinney’s work is, it doesn’t hold a candle to what happens here.
<br>
<br>
First, let’s talk about Dave Fridmann’s production on this thing, oh my is it fantastic. The grittiness and noisiness of the recording really emphasizes the themes of this album, and makes it stand out from Sleater-Kinney’s previous works. The crushing oppression and resulting anger are captured through this grittiness, and the several explosive moments throughout the album. The Woods is a difficult album, and it fits the emotionally difficult story Sleater-Kinney have to tell. This isn’t the same blend of punk rock and pop that preceded it, this is something entirely different. I don’t think the production could possibly be better, Fridmann was 100% the right choice for this album. 
<br>
<br>
“The Fox” is the perfect track to kick off this album, the opening sirens of their guitar here immediately declare what this album is all about. Imagine being trapped inside a box for 25 years and finally breaking out, that’s what this album feels like, and this song captures that impeccably. The grim fairy tale used to paint society’s coaxing us into trusting it is particularly apt given the album’s sound and title, this really works as our entrance into the woods. The vocals on this track, and across the rest of the album, are among the most violent and powerful I have ever heard, and work well with the surrounding production. Where these yelps sounded out of place and rough on their debut, they sound refined and right at home amongst the chaos of everything happening here. This is, without a doubt, one of the best album openers I have ever heard.
<br>
<br>
The beginning section of this album almost feels like a test for the listener, challenging whether or not they’re capable of following them on their journey through the woods. This is perfectly captured on the instrumental break in the middle of the "What's Mine is Yours", where it seems almost as if S/K themselves are struggling to power through and remain strong enough to maintain their energy and deliver their message. They sound powerful and defeated at the same time, fighting until the very last breath to push back against the oppression they face and lack of resources they have. 
<br>
<br>
We then arrive at “Jumpers”, which features Sleater-Kinney at their most vulnerable, as well as Sleater-Kinney at their absolute artistic peak. The comparison between Sleater-Kinney and a cloud in California, the sunny golden state, perfectly shows how they find themselves completely out of place and are told to be happy in order to fit into the supposed beauty of their surrounding world. And the final lyrics(“My falling shape will draw a line between the flow of sea and sky/I’m not a bird, I’m not a plane/I took a taxi to the gate, I will not go to school again/Four seconds was the longest wait”) send chills up my spine every time I hear them. This is Sleater-Kinney at their lowest point, and they do an incredible job of relating their struggles.
<br>
<br>
“Modern Girl” echos this sentiment in its first two verses, but then the song explodes, as Sleater-Kinney refuse to die in the box they've been trapped in, and this is the precursor to then breaking out in the second half of the album. From here on out, aside from “Steep Air”, there is nothing but sheer anger and energy ahead, and it all comes together to form one of the most emotionally and viscerally powerful album halves I’ve ever heard.
<br>
<br>
“Entertain” kicks off the second half right away with an iconic drum intro, much like “The Fox” did with its guitar screech. The drumming on this song, and this album in general, is absolutely spectacular, and should cement Janet Weiss as one of the greatest drummers in rock history (she is criminally underrated). "Entertain" and "Rollercoaster" see Sleater-Kinney angrier than ever, as they take charge and fire back at the boxes that have been trapping them, whether that be the music industry in "Entertain" or a relationship partner in "Rollercoaster".
<br>
<br>
“Steep Air” then serves as the calm before the imminent storm, and the beginning of the end for Sleater-Kinney (before their eventual reunion). Despite the laughs that preceded it at the end of “Rollercoaster”, Sleater-Kinney are still clearly filled with anger, and their words and actions are fueled by an anxiety and sense of urgency, they just cannot last a second longer without acceptance before bursting and taking their anger out on who/whatever is closest. 
<br>
<br>
“Let’s Call It Love” is a whopping 11-minute long track, and every minute of it slowly documents Sleater-Kinney falling apart tragically. Following all of the sadness and anger shown across the previous tracks, it’s not hard to see how Sleater-Kinney can’t hold it together long enough to avoid tearing each other apart. In the context of the rest of the album, especially the next track, it’s clear that no one actually dislikes anyone here. This is not some bitter breakup due to different artistic visions, Corin, Carrie, and Janet clearly still love each other. This is simply the fuel finally running out, and each of the band members finally deciding they need to step away from Sleater-Kinney. There’s only so much a band can be ripped apart for entertainment before they fall apart. It sounds as if Sleater-Kinney always had an expiration date, and they finally reached it. They seemingly try to hold on in the second half, with a lengthy instrumental section that seems to constantly be avoiding an end until it finally arrives. At some point, the end becomes inevitable, and they break out into “Night Light”, where Sleater-Kinney express how difficult it is to remain composed for those you care about in light of these challenges. The struggles that they have documented throughout the album have finally piled on and ultimately destroyed Sleater-Kinney, both as individuals, and as a band. I love how the song ends in the last minute, it slowly fades into Sleater-Kinney’s dismal fate and perfectly captures the seeming helplessness of the situation they find themselves in. What a perfect ending, to a perfect album.
<br>
<br>
The story of this album is incredible, and the pacing only adds to the storytelling and emotional rollercoaster that this album presents. Through the lyrics, performances, and the grimy production, this album beautifully depicts what it's like to be trapped in a box, and presents the relationship between depression and anger in a really challenging, yet captivating way. This is one of the most important albums I have ever heard, and I believe everyone should listen to it. So with all of that said, it should be obvious why I think this is Sleater-Kinney’s best work.
