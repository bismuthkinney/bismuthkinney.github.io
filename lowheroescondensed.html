I believe these albums are inseparable and must be discussed together, as they are pieces of a larger puzzle. I tend to think of these as companion albums, almost completely opposite in approach. Where Low sees Bowie using warmer sounds (and artwork) and focusing on textures, particularly in the instrumental half, “Heroes” sees Bowie emphasizing and rigidity, whether that be through the emotive, at times erratic vocal performances, or the focus on individual sounds and contrasts in the instrumental halves. Low sees Bowie slowly resigning to his depressive state and melting into the surrounding depression of Berlin, while “Heroes” sees him clawing his way out of the walls he (and Berlin) have built up and trying to fight for happiness. The warm, yellow cover of Bowie staring off into the distance beautifully contrasts the black and white cover of Bowie emphasizing angles and rigidity in his posture, and both of these covers are among my all time favorites.
<br>
<br>
Low opens with “Speed of Life”, and I've rambled on about this song towards the end of the longer version of this write-up. This is my favorite song of all time, I love how it echos the sentiments from station to station in a new context to introduce the melancholy of this album. For me, this song captures a moment where Bowie reaches for unattainable happiness as the music swells to a climax, before inevitably crashing back down to the sadness that began the track. 
<br>
<br>
After "Speed of Life", which serves as somewhat of an overture, “Breaking Glass” opens very harshly with its drums and guitar performance, and generally the song just sounds like Bowie breaking the mirror in his room. This is Bowie at his angriest on the album, and the self-hatred and self-deprecation is clear as day here. Eventually, Bowie’s anger fades into sadness throughout the rest of the album. There is still a touch of youthful exuberance found in "What In The World", captured through Bowie's vocal performance as he describes the child inside him longing to escape, but he is soon completely consumed in darkness. 
<br>
<br>
“Sound and Vision” sees Bowie completely wrapped in blue, unable to see or anything but his own internal struggles. The instrumental portion that dominates most of this track is beautiful, and forms a nice buildup to the verse that forms the centerpiece of the song. The vocals here when Bowie sings “blue, blue, electric blue/that’s the color of my room” sound like an attempt to climb out of this blue and ascend to happiness, before he ultimately drops back down to a somber tone to complete the lyric, “where I will live”.  Aside from this opening moment, Bowie sounds completely defeated, desperate to escape, but seemingly aware of how futile this may prove to be.
<br>
<br>
“Always Crashing In The Same Car” is easily the most fully fleshed out track lyrically, and sees Bowie almost looking at himself in the third person, aimlessly driving in circles, making the same mistakes over and over again. The anger and energy from previous tracks has completely disappeared entirely, and the beautiful vocal performance here illustrates Bowie’s complete descent into depression. This is followed by Be My Wife”, the final track with lyrics, which serves as a final cry for help from Bowie. The frantic instrumentation adds a captivating sense of urgency, you feel as if Bowie is doomed to fall to the lowest lows if his final cry for help isn’t answered. 
<br>
<br>
“A New Career in a New Town” kicks off the instrumental half of Low, which sees Bowie moving to Berlin to perhaps reinvigorate his life and career. The instrumentation here balances this spark and hopefulness with the depression from the previous tracks perfectly. 
<br>
<br>
“Warszawa” follows, and Bowie is now consumed by the sadness and despair of 1970s Berlin, divided by the Berlin Wall. This sadness is captured here with a lengthy ambient track that drones on forebodingly. One of the major elements on this album, that aligns with the chosen album structure, is speech. Even in the first half, with lyrical tracks, they are often incredibly blunt and simple, the emphasis is placed on the instrumentation and emotions evoked through how the vocal performances play off of this instrumentation. This gets dialed up on the second half of the album, and especially on this track, where Bowie can do nothing but chant to express the desire to escape the burden he feels. "Art Decade" follows similarly, focusing on texture to depict the slow decay of Bowie’s inspiration, motivation, and eventually Bowie himself. 
<br>
<br>
“Weeping Wall” is slightly different from the preceding tracks, with continuous *plinks* throughout the song attempting to escape the wails that dominate the track.This is like the “Be My Wife” of this half, only this time, there’s nothing to potentially save Bowie from his eventual fate.
<br>
<br>
And so we come to “Subterraneans”. In an album full of despair, in an album full of moments to break us down into tears, this stands out as one of the saddest tracks Bowie has ever created. This track takes a similar approach to “Warszawa”, but features almost incomprehensible lyrics towards the end, Bowie’s final words before he melts into the Berlin soil. As the track closes, it’s clear that this, among his many cries for help across the album, are pointless, and Bowie is now 6 feet under, subterranean. 
<br>
<br>
So there’s Low; to summarize my thoughts, I think that Low is the most vivid and potent artistic portrayal of depression. Low is a relatively straightforward work to understand, there is just this haze of depression that surrounds all of the instrumentation and influences every lyric here, it’s hard to come away from this album without feeling Bowie’s plight. The album has a clear story, and the gradual, linear approach to telling it makes it easy for the listener to grasp and resonate with what’s happening here. 
<br>
<br>
“Heroes” is a different animal altogether, it’s very intricately put together, and there is a huge emphasis on each individual moment here. The narrative here isn’t made as apparent, and unlike Low, I believe only Bowie truly knows what he wants to say here, and how he wants to say it. But that’s not to say I haven’t taken away a lot from this album, so let’s get into my interpretation of “Heroes”.
<br>
<br>
I interpret "Heroes" as somewhat of a double album, the four track stretch from "Joe the Lion" to "Blackout" juxtaposes the four track stretch from "V2 Schneider" to "Neukoln", each depicting the same story from a different side of the Berlin Wall. These stories follow approximately the same trajectory, and they share something with Low. This is in fact the only thing they share with Low, and this is crucial to understanding how I have interpreted this album: Bowie still dies in this album, just as he died in "Subterraneans" at the end of Low. We’ll get there, but establishing this is important to highlight the contrast between both albums. It’s all in how Bowie dies, and what his outlook on life is.
<br>
<br>
“Beauty and the Beast” picks up where we left off from Low, and we see that Bowie is still alive, as he points out “thank God heaven left us, standing on our feet”. This is the beginning of the upward climb from the lows that the previous album left us in, and production perfectly captures how Bowie is clawing his way back up.
<br>
<br>
From the track title, “Beauty and the Beast”, it’s quickly apparent that dichotomy is a major theme on this record, this plays heavily into the statement that this record makes. The main question that pervades throughout the record is, “Who are the heroes?”, and two distinct dichotomies present an answer to this. The first, which is clear from the conceptual division of this album, is the dichotomy between West Berlin, presented as the wild, frenetic first half, and East Berlin, presented as the foreboding instrumental second half. Neither of these are the answer, and Bowie is not making a statement about his politics here. In fact, as we will discuss with “Joe the Lion” and “V2 Schneider”, he celebrates the culture of both sides, and the influence they’ve had on his music. We’ll get to the second dichotomy at the very end, though it will likely be discussed here and there as it turns up in a few of the tracks on the first half.
<br>
<br>
“Joe the Lion”/”V2 Schneider”: Both of these tracks are appetizers in a way, introducing you to their respective sides of Berlin, culturally and sonically. “Joe the Lion” presents West Berlin as a fun, wild party essentially, where the town (and the track as a result) is booming with energy. “V2 Schneider” is quite the opposite. “V2 Schneider” uses its horns to portray a happiness and pride across East Berlin that matches the joy and passion of “Joe the Lion”. But the personality here is entirely different, “V2 Schneider” uses drums to create a military-like atmosphere, and in general this track contrasts the spontaneity of the first half with its rigid structure and slow buildup. With these two tracks, Bowie makes it clear that he believes the distinction of who the heroes are doesn’t come down to which side of the wall they lie on. Now that we’ve established that, and introduced the Berlin Wall, let’s get to the next song.
<br>
<br>
“Heroes” features arguably the most compelling vocal performance I’ve ever heard. Listening to Bowie wail “I, I will be king!” truly captures him fighting his way back towards happiness, as well as the sentiment of couples separated by the wall, searching for the moment where the wall no longer impedes them, and they are on top of the world. And this is where Bowie paints who the heroes are, they’re people just like us. They’re people who keep pushing forward despite the obstacles in their way, who keep trudging onto new heights without settling, who fight for what they believe in till their very last breath. This is echoed in "Sons of the Silent Age", which features lyrics chastising silence and a similarly powerful vocal perfomance as Bowie wails “Baby, I won’t ever let you down/I can’t stand another sound/Let’s find another way down”. 
<br>
<br>
“Blackout” sees Bowie depicting, well, a blackout, in this case referring to his life. But compare this to “Subterraneans”, and it’s clear that he’s dying under completely different circumstances. The frantic vocal performance and production here, and the lines “Get me off the streets/Get some protection!/Get me on my feet/Get some direction!” make it clear that he’s fighting for his happiness till the very last breath, rather than slowly melting away. Now that we’ve completed Bowie’s West Berlin tale, let’s head over the wall to the East side.
<br>
<br>
“Sense of Doubt” follows "V2 Schneider" to kick off the East Berlin side of the tale, and is perhaps best explained by contrasting it to “Warszawa” from Low. Both depict the looming oppression that is felt throughout Berlin, but where “Warszawa” emphasizes the feeling of helplessness by drowning the entire track in ambience, while “Sense of Doubt” presents a clear pushback through distinct moments that stand out from the surrounding ambience. The title puts it perfectly, there is a sense of doubt, and this song poses the question: Will you fight back?
<br>
<br>
“Sense of Doubt” segues right into “Moss Garden”, which takes a more serene, tranquil approach to the themes evoked on the previous track. The *plinks* (sorry, hopefully you know what I mean) provide a clear sense of tension, but throughout most of the track they do nothing but add to the beauty of the surrounding ambience instead. Silence is treated with beauty here, but while that does convey a sense of peace, as the track nears its end, it’s clear that the tension presented is mounting, and that this beauty is fleeting. 
<br>
<br>
“Neukoln” begins with several smaller sounds (I really have no idea what to call these) that slowly accumulate and build tension, until they collectively snap and kick the song into gear. The rest of this song parallels “Blackout” well, the horns mirror the unease brought by the frenetic pace and vocals there, and the same image is painted. Bowie is fighting for happiness, fighting for what matters to him, until his last breath. The horns build up towards the end and eventually, one final, prolonged note signals the end. Yet again, Bowie has died, but again, this song starkly contrasts “Subterraneans”. Bowie refuses to melt into his depression, and claws his way out as best he can.
<br>
<br>
“The Secret Life of Arabia” closes out "Heroes", and is a very abstract track that doesn’t quite make it’s messages clear like most of the tracks on both of these records do. Instead, it focuses on painting an image of an evergreen, expansive land (Arabia), which I think is referring to heaven, given my interpretation of “Blackout” and “Neukoln”. Now that Bowie has spent his life looking to build himself up and fight for his dearest causes, he finds himself in heaven, able to look back satisfied that he gave it all he got. And this is the happiness he has been seeking, dating back to Station to Station. This track affirms the beliefs presented in previous tracks, despite the fact that Bowie dies in all 3 (including Low) storylines, he has still achieved the inner peace he desires in the latter 2, where he refused to stay silent. Personally, this album emphasized the importance of intent, and how this can frame our happiness better than a reliance on the outside world to do so. Manufacturing happiness is difficult, but Bowie has seemingly done so over the course of this album, and “The Secret Life of Arabia” affirms the inner peace that arises as a result. This song is not only the end of “Heroes”, but the end of the 1977 storyline, and the end of an era for Bowie. Bowie has climbed his way out from depression and can move on, at long last. 
<br>
<br>
And there it is, Low and “Heroes”, two of the greatest albums ever made. Together, these albums form the one of the most emotionally powerful and intellectually captivating artistic statements ever, and paint a beautiful blueprint for deconstructing depression and constructing happiness. Even looking past my interpreations of these albums, the way production is used on both albums to build an atmosphere of sadness and tension, and the incredible vocal performances capturing Bowie's misery on Low and passion on "Heroes", are reason enough to place these albums among the greatest of all time.
