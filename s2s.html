This is perhaps many people's choice for the best Bowie album, and it's clear to see why it's an absolute masterpiece. The way Bowie presents his vulnerability and fragility here is absolutely stellar. Even though Bowie is playing a character again, the "Thin White Duke" this time, a lot of the lyrics and vocal performances show just how raw and deeply personal the songs here are. Every song here is absolutely incredible, but there are only two I need to discuss in depth to capture how brilliant of a record this is:
<br>
<br>
“Station to Station”: It’s not that Bowie had never made a long, sprawling song before. “The Width of a Circle” was 8 minutes long. It’s the 3 minutes of train chugging that kicks off the song and the switch up in the middle. Now was this the most experimental, cutting edge track at the time? No, “Echoes” came out 5 years before this. But this marked a clear change for Bowie in terms of changing his sound and pushing himself. All while coked up and on a diet of milk and red peppers somehow, how he accomplished this, I have no clue. “Station to Station” sees Bowie reference a new character, the Thin White Duke, who perfectly captures Bowie at the time. Previous characters of Bowie’s have always felt like pieces of himself, specific masks that he wanted to wear as he portrayed himself to the media. The Thin White Duke is different, this is just David Bowie at his most vulnerable, disguised as another character. And the Thin White Duke doesn’t have a glamorous backstory like the other characters, in fact he doesn’t have much of a story at all, he just lives his life from day to day, from station to station, without really experiencing any moment deeply enough for there to be a story to tell. The transition section here is painfully beautiful, as Bowie gracefully sings about how vivid his experiences used to be, before essentially turning into nothing. And of course, my favorite line here: “It’s not the side effects of the cocaine/I’m thinking that it must be love”. The denial and lack of self-awareness, juxtaposed with the yearning for love is a brutally depressing look for Bowie, and one that he perfectly captures on this track.
<br>
<br>
“Stay”: The first half of this song just sees Bowie rambling on and on about how he wants this girl to stay, but can’t quite string the words together to confidently tell her so. Again, Bowie’s yearning for love is put on full display next to the apparent mess that he is, drowning in cocaine and bad habits as he lives a blurry life, desperately waiting for someone to pull him out of it and restore the vividness and joy he once experienced. The second half of this song is an amazing solo that takes over the song and carries it to its end, and I absolutely love it. The instrumentation here is amazing, and the energy here is unmatched. This is definitely my favorite track off of this record.
<br>
<br>
Every other track here is brilliant too, “Golden Years” and “TVC15” are fun additions to the tracklist, and “Word On A Wing” and “Wild Is The Wind” show Bowie at his finest vocally. The latter in particular is a beautiful and aptly chosen cover which echos many of themes from the title track. Bowie perfectly captures how he is floating aimlessly, with what may very well be his greatest vocal performance right next to "Heroes". It's a shame Bowie apparently doesn't remember recording much of this album, because it's clear how emotionally charged and passionate he is about the pain and emptiness he's experiencing.
