What is the value of the regular season?

With most of my posts, I have a clear position or point in mind that I want to dive deeper into. But with this post, I'm honestly just asking, what is the value of the regular season?
<br>
<br>
If you didn't read my Play-In post, I'll sum it up a bit here: I'm a bit apprehensive because it feels a bit arbitrary and unfair, but even past that, I'm worried for the narrative wasteland that it might create as it redefines what it takes to make the playoffs. My position was that those two games had the potential to reshape legacies, and in that way devalue what took place in the regular season. Others don't seem to be concerned with that, or have faith that the NBA will tweak the play-in games over time to circumvent these issues. Many argue that it enhances the regular season viewing experience, and I can't disagree.
<br>
<br>
But that got me thinking: what is the value of the regular season? Obviously from a business standpoint it makes sense: 82 games means a lot of advertising and a lot of ticket sales. But for both fans and players, it seems as though the importance of the regular season isn't so apparent, especially when we look back and judge players' careers.
<br>
<br>
Now, I prefaced this by saying that I wasn't taking a clear stance, so let me list off the obvious pros first: the iconic moments. Without the stage of the regular season, you would lose some of the magic from various MVP campaigns and other showcases of talent. The viewing experience of the NBA regular season is such a blessing to any hardcore basketball fan, but you didn't need me to tell you that. 
<br>
<br>
The main question I have with the regular season however has nothing to do with the viewing experience in the moment, and everything to do with how we evaluate player's legacies. Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places (those being sports media, twitter, youtube comments, etc), but the way we diminish players' achievements and the "but what about in the playoffs" mentality really devalues the regular season.
<br>
<br>
I find it hard to draw that line, on one hand the playoffs are supposed to be where legacies are made, a championship is the ultimate team goal. But on the other hand, a body of work over an 82 game stretch is hard to simply sleep on. 2016 Steph is a good example (I know injuries were a factor, but he made mental mistakes regardless and it was clear that physicality bothered him). 2016 Steph had one of the most legendary regular season campaigns in NBA history, and it absolutely enhances his legacy a lot. But the 2016 finals is a huge blow to his legacy, and it's difficult to balance these two side by side. Sure it's an extreme example, but it definitely paints a picture for how the playoffs can devalue regular season accomplishments with how we judge players' legacies.
<br>
<br>
Another interesting case to look at is Kawhi Leonard, who may very well finish his career without a single regular season MVP (scorching hot take, he should have won in 2017, but that's beside the point). Kawhi has been one of the biggest targets for the "anti-load management" sect of NBA fans, but are we going to care 10 years from now? Especially if he can get another ring, how much does not having an MVP really mean for his legacy? I highly doubt Kawhi cares, and I don't think I would either.
<br>
<br>
So with all that said, when it comes to how we view the regular season, in some ways it really just feels like the cherry on top for many players. Something that's nice to have, but is very much secondary to the playoffs. So with all of this talk about the play-in game adding value to the regular season, the cynical part of me finds it hard to care. Part of me would just swing in the other direction: shorten the regular season to like 40-50 games and treat it as just a means for seeding teams. 
<br>
<br>
But I would never actively advocate for that, because like I said at the start, I honestly just don't know what the balance is. So I ask you, what is the value of the regular season?
