2021 Playoff Predictions: Round 1
</h1>
<p style="font-size:14px;text-align:left;">

<p style="text-align:left;">
I wanted to just dive in and do a whole playoff bracket like I usually do before the playoffs, but I really felt like there is so much uncertainty just in the first round. So I've chosen to start with round 1 predictions, and I'll finish the bracket once we learn more. Also, I am making assumptions about who the winners of the play-in games will be. I might revise the bracket if I'm wrong, we'll see.
<br>
<br>
<b>(1) Utah Jazz vs. (8) Memphis Grizzlies: Jazz win 4-0</b> 
<br>
<br>
Pain. I would go on about how upset I am that the Warriors lost the play-in, but I'll save that for another time. This series won't be interesting, easy sweep, not much to say. 
<br>
<br>
<b>(2) Phoenix Suns vs. (7) Los Angeles Lakers: Suns win 4-3</b> 
<br>
<br>
I'm picking this as a 7 game series because I genuinely don't know which way this is going to go. It's pretty funny that picking the 2 seed here might actually be the real "upset", but if I had to pick a team I would go with the Suns. Are the Lakers the better team? Absolutely. But for some reason I'm just not sure about the health of this team, their chemistry together, and the pairing of Drummond and AD. To me, the Lakers have the widest range of outcomes based on whether everything falls into place or not. If it does, they could very well win the title. If not, I see them losing to the Suns, who have been fantastic all year on both ends of the floor. I expect Devin Booker to put on a show in his first playoff appearance, and CP3 will obviously be brilliant as a floor general and clutch shotmaker. If everyone else can play as well as they have all season, I think the Suns have a real shot. 
<br>
<br>
<b>(3) Denver Nuggets vs. (6) Portland Trail Blazers: Blazers win 4-3</b> 
<br>
<br>
Am I in the minority on this one? The last couple of years when Denver had impressive postseasons, a lot of the attention was on Jamal Murray, but I insisted that Jokic was clearly their best and most important player, and the guy I would count on to make clutch plays down the stretch. But even though he now sits as the MVP (at least that's who should win), I can't see them going far without Jamal Murray by his side. MPJ has been good this year and could take a jump these playoffs, but I need to see it to believe it. Even though the Blazers are not good on defense, I think they have enough to just outscore the Nuggets a bunch of times. I expect Lillard to have a great series, mainly feeding off of last year's quick defeat, and I think him and CJ will be enough to edge out a series win. I could see this going either way, but I'm picking the Blazers.
<br>
<br>
<b>(4) Los Angeles Clippers vs. (5) Dallas Mavericks: Clippers win 4-2</b> 
<br>
<br>
This is just going to be a repeat of last year. I have no clue as to how Porzingis is going to hold up in the playoffs, and even with the Mavericks at full strength, I just don't think they're a match for the Clippers. Sure, Luka is going to go off again. But I don't expect a whole lot from Porzingis, and I don't trust the other guys to kill the Clippers 4/7 games. Plus, I think the Clippers are better than last year: Rondo and Ibaka are pickups I like, and I have faith in the Clippers' improved chemistry and playmaking abilities. So long as Pandemic P doesn't create too much of a disaster for the Clippers, they should win this series.

<b>(1) Philadelphia 76ers vs. (8) Washington Wizards: 76ers win 4-0</b> 
<br>
<br>
So the 76ers revenge tour doesn't begin with the Boston Celtics, like I thought it would. I'm keeping my analysis mostly the same from before, just so I can continue calling this the revenge tour for the 76ers.
<br>
<br>
In 2 of the last 3 postseasons, I have clowned the 76ers for losing to the Celtics (yes, even last year when they didn't have Ben Simmons, because they got swept). I have never believed in the 76ers, but that changed this season. I'm suspecting it was the hiring of Doc Rivers (and firing of Brett Brown) that changed things, but the 76ers have been really impressive this season. And the Wizards have turned their season around and are peaking around the right time, but I still don't think they have enough on both ends to keep up. If Beal goes off for like 50 in a game, sure. Otherwise, I think this is a sweep. Not because the Wizards are bad by any means. I just think the 76ers will be that dominant these playoffs.
<br>
<br>
<b>(2) Brooklyn Nets vs. (7) Boston Celtics: Nets win 4-1</b> 
<br>
<br>
Easy gentleman sweep. I'll slot in a heroic performance from Tatum to win one, but otherwise there's not much I have to say. Am I fully sold on the Nets' defense? Maybe not, but they don't need that this series. KD can just go out there and calmly average 35 for the series. And Harden can put up an easy double-double. Light work.
<br>
<br>
<b>(3) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (6) Miami Heat: Bucks win 4-3</b> 
<br>
<br>
Ohh, the media is going to have a field day if Giannis loses this series. I don't think he will, mainly because he has Jrue Holiday on his team this time. But that's the only reason I'm giving the Bucks the edge; I still haven't seen enough from Giannis to be that sure. I picked Bucks in 7 last year because I wasn't sure, and I'm still not sold on them.
<br>
<br>
<b>(4) New York Knicks vs. (5) Atlanta Hawks: Knicks win 4-2</b> 
<br>
<br>
This is easily the series I care the least about (sorry Knicks and Hawks fans), and also easily the series I know the least about. I've watched like 2 Hawks games this season, so take this prediction with a huge grain of salt if you want. But I've been impressed with the Knicks defensively, and I trust Derrick Rose to elevate his game in the playoffs. Not that he'll be back to prime Rose or anything, but of anyone on the floor for both teams, I trust Rose to get me a bucket or make a play. Maybe I'll be wrong if Trae Young and Capela have great series, but until I see that happen I'm picking the Knicks.
