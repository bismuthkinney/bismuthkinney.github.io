Why do we celebrate "physicality" in the NBA?

You’ve heard someone say it before: “The NBA was tougher in the 90s”, “NBA players today are soft, they would have gotten beat up in the 90s”. As we’ve engaged in discussions about comparing eras, we’ve all conceded that this is somewhat true, the 90s were a more physical league which made it more difficult to score in. But is that a good thing? Why do so many fans glorify the 90s on the basis of “it was more physical”?
<br>
<br>
Now, I should acknowledge that it is possible to swing too far in the other direction, which we have seen over the last few seasons. Techs just for yelling “and 1”, rip-through fouls, and really low standards for what deserves a flagrant foul are certainly issues in today’s game that “soften” it in a negative way. Some may argue that too many fouls are called for seemingly incidental contact, and I wouldn’t necessarily disagree. 
<br>
<br>
But with all of that said, I think the game is in an alright place today in how it rewards skill (especially shooting skill), and I would even argue that it’s better than the 90s. You may take that with a grain (or pile) of salt because I never watched 90s basketball live, but I’ll discuss three things that will hopefully convince you. 
<br>
<br>
First I should note, my analysis is based on the belief that basketball rules should promote / reward skill and talent, and I’m going to argue why “skill” and “physicality” are at odds. If you just disagree because “basketball should be physical” or think I’m being a “snowflake”, then I can’t really convince you. 
<br>
<br>
<u>1. Hand Checking</u>
<br>
Hand checking has been touted as an obstacle which many 90s players had to overcome when scoring. And yes, of course this is true, but was it really an obstacle that we should be celebrating? Do we really want to bring hand checking back? 
<br>
<br>
Now maybe I shouldn’t simply say that “hand checking doesn’t require any skill”, because it’s probably not that easy to do at the highest level. But it’s undeniably an advantage for defensive players that feels cheap, as it’s more based in physicality than skill. You’re not stopping a guy because of your lateral quickness, reaction time, positioning, or anything else that would point to your defensive IQ / skill; you’re just limiting his offensive game by physically impeding his movement.
<br>
<br>
<u>2. Defensive 3-second Rule</u>
<br>
I don’t have a strong opinion on the defensive 3 second rule, I instead want to talk about the issue it was aiming to solve, which is one piece of a larger issue. We hear a lot about how [insert guard here] would have a harder time driving to the basket because of the bigs blocking the paint in the 90s. And from a defensive pressure standpoint, I agree; perhaps the defensive 3 second rule is too restrictive for defenses. But there are some who will point to intentional fouls / hard fouls as a deterrent to driving the basketball, and I can’t see how that’s a selling point for 90s basketball. Do we really want players hesitant to drive because of the threat of physicality (and in the worst case, injury)? In general, defensive positioning and skill should strike fear in the opposing offensive players, not the threat of physicality. 
<br>
<br>
<u>3. Off-Ball Movement</u>
<br>
Up until now, I don’t think I’ve said anything that hasn’t been said a million times before. But I don’t see the physicality associated with off-ball movement discussed enough (unless you’re a Curry fan like me, in which case you complain about it every week). Players today are grabbed, scratched, bumped, and shoved off ball, and it was likely 10x worse in the 90s. And to me, that’s a clear cut case of physicality at odds with skills; off-ball movement is one of the most fundamental and skillful parts of the game, and it is often hindered or even negated by grabbing or shoving a cutter. I would argue that celebrating that extent of physicality is at odds with what makes basketball beautiful and nuanced, and should be actively frowned upon in our league. 
<br>
<br>
Maybe I should have made this clearer at the beginning: none of this is to dismiss the accomplishments of 90s players, especially those that were able to put up historic numbers in spite of these obstacles. All of this discussion is to fight back against the notion that the game was better in the 90s because of its physicality; the game has its issues today but it rewards skill and basketball IQ in a way that makes it compelling to watch. And it’s also to stop the common argument I see when comparing players across eras: even if it’s true that “[insert player here] couldn’t play as well in the 90s, it was too physical for him”, that’s not a compelling argument because it doesn’t say much about his skill as a player.
