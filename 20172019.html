I know this decade has just begun, and there are many artists with the potential to put out a masterpiece. But until that happens, I have no qualms recognizing this as my album of the decade thus far. This isn't quite a 10/10, but it is certainly one of the most captivating, consistent, and cohesive electronic albums in a long time, dare I say the best since Aphex Twin's drukqs?
<br>
<br>
Nicolas Jaar put out some great music last decade, from his fantastically immersive debut, Space is Only Noise, to his recent compilation of intoxicating house tracks, 2012-2017. It's certainly very difficult to pick out his best album, and while I wouldn't call this his magnum opus (I'd give that to Sirens, because of how deeply personal it is to Jaar), I think he's caught lightning in a bottle here. There isn't a single misstep here, and the flow between all of these tracks is incredible. It may not be his most intricately complex, or his most ambitious album, but I think it's still his best work.
<br>
<br>
2017-2019 opens with "Fantasy", which quickly lets you know you're in for a rough, gritty ride, especially compared to 2012-2017. Then the sample comes in, and it's absolutely sublime. I love the vocal performance in the sample itself, and I love the way it's chopped up and employed throughout the track. Just as the track begins to lose steam, Jaar then sets the sample aside temporarily and embraces the noisiness and chaos of the surrounding production, and I think it really elevates the track. The sample comes back as the track closes, and it segues seamlessly into the next song.
<br>
<br>
"If Loving You Is Wrong" crashes in from the previous track and mellows the album out as it employs a mellower sample. Again, I love the choice of sample, the vocal performance is fantastic. "If Loving You Is Wrong" carries on much as "Fantasy" did, riding the sample for a while, then drowning it out and allowing the production to take center stage. Even in this mellower track, it is clear that the roughness and chaos is still present, especially towards the end of the track. 
<br>
<br>
"If Loving You Is Wrong" then segues into "With an Addict" and we're thrust again into chaos, though it retains the mellowness of the previous track. The beginning section of this track is fantastically spontaneous, and it sets the stage for later in the track. The track mellows out, the chaos along with sampled vocals linger in the background, but for a moment there is peace on the album. "With an Addict" provides you with a breather after the energy and grittiness of the first two tracks, slowly building you up until you're ready again to revisit the chaos introduced at the beginning. Decisions like these are what make this album so fantastic to me, "With an Addict" follows a fairly simple formula, but its placement in the album is what elevates it. I'll keep coming back to this, but the noisiness and chaos are the centerpieces of this album; how they are balanced throughout the album is what makes the album flow so spectacularly.
<br>
<br>
And now that you've had a break, Jaar thrusts you into "If You Can't Do It Good, Do It Hard". Jaar reintroduces the noisiness, though this time the emphasis isn't how busy or chaotic it is, but rather how ominous and foreboding the track is. It progressively builds as you await Lydia Lunch's aggresive vocal performance, then it throws it all at you in an effort to weigh you down with anxiousness. And then, just as the track begins to die down...
<br>
<br>
The opening blares of "Alarm" perfectly capture why I love this album. Don't dismiss this as a prelude to "Deeeeeeefers", this is the centerpiece of the album. This is the culmination of all of the previous tracks: the noisiness, the chaos, and the foreboding buildup of "If You Can't Do It Good, Do It Hard". The world that this album has built has fallen apart in a second, and you're engulfed in noise and chaos. This segues right into "Deeeeeeefers", which evokes much of the same response, embracing the chaos in what is an absolute banger of a track. "Deeeeeeefers" allows some reprieve and preparation in the middle of the track for the listener, but otherwise Jaar forces you to embrace the chaos, and this track is incredibly gratifying when you do. 
<br>
<br>
"Deeeeeeefers" then flows right into "Faith", completely abandoning the chaos and noise as the atmosphere the album has presented seemingly attempts to rebuild itself from scratch. "Faith" and "Penny" are much different from what came before; there's a calculated approach to these tracks and a heavier emphasis on emotion rather than chaos. "Faith" slowly builds as hints of the ominous atmosphere from "If You Can't Do It Good, Do It Hard" linger, while "Penny" is more hopeful and less restrictive as it progressively reintroduces the noisiness from tracks like "Fantasy". Both of these do an excellent job of progressively building this atmosphere anew with a precise approach to the production; though these tracks aren't as immediately gratifying, there is never a dull moment here, and there a lot to discover as you dive in.
<br>
<br>
Though "Penny" seemingly ends on a happy note, "You (forever)" closes the album suggesting that the darkness, grittiness, and chaos that had engulfed the album is still present. Jaar, through the production choices, finds it difficult to even reach the finish line of this song. Though "Penny" had left us with hope, "You (forever)" still plenty of anxiousness and pain left to show, and it's a perfect way to close out the album. 
<br>
<br>
The production choices on this album are fantastic, the noisiness and chaos evoke an emotional response such in a beautiful way, and while the album has no clear narrative, it flows in a very methodical way and takes its listeners along for a ride through this world Jaar has built. Every track here is impactful, deeply layered, and absolutely essential in creating an incredible experience. I dont' think an album has achieved such feats with just instrumentals and samples in a long time, and it's why I have it as my album of the decade. Of course, until Kendrick drops his next album and it's a 10/10 (spoiler alert: I doubt it will be).
