The NBA doesn’t understand statistics

Ohh, NBA stats. A godsend for some, a nightmare for others, and a topic in the NBA that couldn’t possibly be more polarizing. So it’s fitting that this topic is approached with absolutely no nuance by most NBA fans. Older NBA fans and players will often call NBA stats (especially more advanced metrics) useless and I generally do agree, but I want to argue this position more effectively here. As a guy who values statistics and used them a lot in college, I want to go deeper into why NBA stats can’t completely replace the eye test.
<br>
<br>
First, I want to go into what it even means to statistically analyze the NBA, and argue why "NBA Stats" are incomplete. It irritates me when people say that "statistics are a record of what happened". Perhaps I’m nitpicking, but I think the distinction I’m going to make is an important one. <u>Data</u> are a record of what happened, statistics are just the way we choose to report it. In the case of NBA stats, we choose to simplify the data to make it easily digestible. 
<br>
<br>
When compiling NBA stats, we usually either report and average or a total over a period of time, even though each of the 48 minutes (and each of the 60 seconds in those minutes) is unique and important in its own right. A complete analysis of this data would have to involve graphs, but imagine making graphs for every stat for every player. We're forced to cut corners, because there is simply way too much data to properly analyze in the NBA. We also don't report standard deviation or any other measure of the spread of data, which is very important in its own right. NBA stats simply don't account for a players consistency, especially when we're looking at data from past seasons. We're forced to cut corners, because there is simply way too much data to properly analyze in the NBA.
<br>
<br>
Now I want to discuss why basketball isn't really a game that can be summarized with numbers; it's much more qualitative than some fans give it credit for. Basketball has plenty of points, rebounds, and assists to track, some of us think of it as a very quantitative game, but it's really not, because of three main things: context, floor geometry, and the fact that it's 5-on-5.
<br>
<br>
Context is an obvious point that's been done to death before, so I won't spend too much time on it. The simple takeway is that numbers tell you what happened, not how it happened.
<br>
<br>
Floor geometry is something that has also been discussed plenty, but I feel still gets underlooked. Floor spacing, player positioning, and off-ball movement are fairly underappreciated aspects of basketball that need to be analyzed visually to completely evaluate a player on offense & defense; they can never be properly analyzed with numbers. Sure we have taken strides by tracking things like miles ran, shot distance, charges taken, deflections, but they don't inform us where these things happened, which is crucial.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, basketball is a 5-on-5 game. There are a lot of advanced metrics that aim to evaluate teams and players for their impact on both ends of the court. These stats are probably more useful at a team level, as a decent approximation/summary for a team's performance. But for an individual player, and especially for a key player present in multiple lineups, they're much less effective. Other teammates will almost certainly affect your performance, sometimes in ways you can't control, which is difficult to account for with advanced metrics like Offensive Rating and +/-. (A simple example, your teammate turns it over as you're executing a play, and the opponents score as a result).
<br>
<br>
In summary, just watch the damn games. NBA statistics are a handy tool to recall details for certain events, but they shouldn't be used as the basis for an argument. When it comes to basketball analysis, nothing will ever beat the eye test.
