Avengers: Endgame is my least favorite of the four Avengers movies. It's not the worst; though I prefer Age of Ultron, the villain's "personality" is a really poor choice, and that film is only great for how it begins to set up the conflict in Civil War, not as a standalone film.
<br>
<br>
So why do I hate this movie so much? (Hate is a strong word but it's like a 6/10 to me). Well, I don't like the fact that it even exists in the first place, but I'll save that point for last. First, let me just list the reasons I don't really care for much of this movie based on what it presents.
<br>
<br>
<u>1. Captain Marvel</u>
<br>
<br>
I doubt I need to explain myself much on this one, Captain Marvel really didn't make sense to include in this movie. I find it especially clunky here because of the can of worms that is inherently opened when Captain Marvel shows up: where was she all this time? was she not in contact with Nick Fury? did she know about the Avengers, and if so, why did she wait so long to introduce herself? This movie wants to just breeze past all of these questions with either quick answers or non-answers and accept Captain Marvel as a part of the team. And her personality doesn't help at all. When Tony is an arrogant asshole, we understand that he's a genius with clear motivations for his actions, and even then we see characters regularly push back against his decisions. But here everyone, characters and audience, are just expected to accept Captain Marvel because she happens to be the strongest Avenger? They really should have waited to introduce Captain Marvel, because integrating her into the team, having the team trust her and having her accept them and learn to work with others is way more involved than this movie makes it out to be. 
<br>
<br>
<u>2. Time Travel</u>
<br>
<br>
I think time travel was a dumb choice. I think it's way too convoluted, and even if I think I get it, it's hard to be sure that I'm right about how the rules work generally. The infinity stone aspect of it is explained simply enough, you have to return the infinity stones to exactly when you took them. But what about other actions, do those create alternate timelines/realities? Based on my understanding of the rules, doesn't the final scene with Captain America break them? How does he appear on the bench in the main timeline as an old man, while also having not affected the main timeline in any other way? Maybe if this one hole didn't exist I'd be fine, all they needed to do was have Cap teleport back as an old man, instead of have him on the bench. But as soon as you make one little slip up, the whole thing falls apart. Plus, now we have a universe where time travel is possible (unless they cop out by removing the ability to make Pym particles). They treat this pretty nonchalantly in the movie, where Tony just casually rolls up to the Avengers compound and quips about figuring it out. But, this is a huge deal. Even if it worked for this movie, was it worth it for the can of worms opened in subsequent films?
<br>
<br>
<u>3. The Final Battle</u>
<br>
<br>
Up until now, I don't think anything I've said has been too divisive. Maybe you even agree with me to an extent, but find that these points don't really hold back the film because of the eventual payoff in the final act. Ok, here's where I anger people: the final act is the most poorly executed part of the film. The first act is really great minus the Captain Marvel nonsense, and the second act is alright even if it is a bit "fan service-y" in some spots. But the final act of this film is really just goes through the motions until it's finally time for Tony to do his thing.
<br>
<br>
One of the two main reasons for this is Thanos: Thanos is so bland in this movie. I didn't just want Infinity War Thanos again, I like that they take him in a different direction now that he sees that people won't be grateful for his actions, and I like some of the dialogue written for him. But why is he still so calm, stoic, and apathetic. His entire life's mission has been invalidated, and he's lost all respect and consideration for the heroes he's fighting against. His words hint at a newfound fury and determination to kill, and even a bit of arrogance and disdain, but his actions and expressions hardly show it. They could have made this battle incredibly emotional, but instead they went for scale.
<br>
<br>
The second reason is the pacing and structure of the battle. Again, it feels like it just goes through the motions formulaically until it's finally time for Tony to sacrifice himself. There are like 3-4 major reveals in this battle to get the audience cheering, which is way too many. By the time we get to the end of the battle, Cap summoning Mjolnir hardly feels special anymore. Contrast this with the battle of Wakanda, where there's only one major reveal: Thor shows up with Stormbreaker. (Wanda doesn't count because we know she's there the whole time, and Thanos's plan revolves around baiting her out) Even though they end up losing the battle, that moment has weight because it shifted the tides of the battle and we were allowed to soak that moment in. With the Endgame battle, within 3 minutes of Cap using Mjolnir, Thanos has beaten them down and we're moving onto something else. Tony's sacrificial moment is fantastic, but everything building up to it is an absolute mess.
<br>
<br>
So that's why I think Endgame is poorly executed, but honestly even if it were a good film, I might still have issues with it, because it detracts from Infinity War. There's one moment in Infinity War which essentially birthed Endgame, and it's easily the poorest decision in the film. 
<br>
<br>
I think the moments I'm referring to are obvious, as they're incredibly iconic. "How many do we win? 1." and "Why'd you do that? We're in the endgame now." were just meh lines at first, but the more I rewatch Infinity War, they quite simply ruin what the film could have been, a subversive, and grim masterpiece. These scenes rob the future events of any consequence because they dictate the final outcome. Because Dr. Strange knows all of the potential outcomes, we no longer have any reason to question his choices. It's lazy writing to justify giving up the Time Stone and justify why he can't share this knowledge with Tony or anyone else. And when you look even further, and recall from the Doctor Strange film that sorcerors can't see past their death, it's clear that Doctor Strange must have known that the death wasn't permanent, making it incredibly difficult to feel the weight of the snap on subsequent rewatches. Just in general, reviving all of the characters and making the death temporary severely softens the impact of the previous film. I know they planned it all out beforehand, but it feels as though they made a daring artistic choice, and then walked it back. Infinity War was centered around how the Avengers' disjointedness, their individual flaws, and their limits with regards to sacrifice brought upon failure, but from our vantage point it was never permanent and it got erased fairly quickly. Sure they had to grapple with this failure for 5 years, but we see very little of this.
<br>
<br>
I wanted to see the Avengers grapple with failure, guilt, and grief, but we only get this in flashes in the first act of the film (plus Tony's and Thor's arcs in the movie). Instead, Endgame wants to focus on fan service and reviving characters that should be dead, going against what made Infinity War so great and relegating itself to being "just another superhero film". And for those reasons, I find it hard to appreciate the direction the movie chose to go in. All in all, based on how the events of Endgame played out, I think Infinity War should have ended Phase 3, and Phase 4 should have taken place in this new world, where half the planet is lost and our heroes need to reassess how they can protect it.
