I think this is one of the best albums anyone has ever made, and that anyone could ever make; there’s only a handful of albums I think are on par with this. Despite how brilliant much of the rest of Sleater-Kinney’s work is, it doesn’t hold a candle to what happens here. My top ten Sleater-Kinney song list is simply this album (not in the same order but you get the point), every track here is S/K at their absolute best. I’m going to go through this track by track and dive into the story of this album, hopefully convincing you why it is one of the most important and legendary albums to ever exist.
<br>
<br>
Before that, let’s talk about Dave Fridmann’s production on this thing, oh my is it fantastic. The grittiness and noisiness of the recording really emphasizes the themes of this album, and makes it stand out from Sleater-Kinney’s previous works. The crushing oppression and resulting anger are captured through this grittiness, and the several explosive moments throughout the album. The Woods is a difficult album, and it fits the emotionally difficult story Sleater-Kinney have to tell. This isn’t the same blend of punk rock and pop that preceded it, this is something entirely different. I don’t think the production could possibly be better, Fridmann was 100% the right choice for this album. Okay, with that out of the way, let’s journey into The Woods.
<br>
<br>
“The Fox”: What a way to start off the album, the opening sirens of their guitar here immediately declare what this album is all about. Imagine being trapped inside a box for 25 years and finally breaking out, that’s what this album feels like, and this song captures that impeccably. The grim fairy tale used to paint society’s coaxing us into trusting it is particularly apt given the album’s sound and title, this really works as our entrance into the woods. Before I move on to the next track, there’s one last thing I can’t leave untouched. The vocals on this track are among the most violent and powerful I have ever heard, and work well with the surrounding production. Where these yelps sounded out of place and rough on their debut, they sound refined and right at home amongst the chaos of everything happening here. This is, without a doubt, one of the best album openers I have ever heard.
<br>
<br>
“Wilderness”: This is probably the weakest track on the album, but it’s still a well written tale of a couple with conflicting interests (which I believe is based on Carrie’s parents, but don’t quote me on that). As you trek through the rest of the album, it becomes clear how this experience impacts the emotional struggles experienced later. Without a clear confidant or role model, combined with society’s assertion that women should just tag along with men on their career endeavors, it’s not hard to see why Sleater-Kinney feels the sorrow and helplessness they do throughout the first half of this album.
<br>
<br>
“What’s Mine Is Yours”: Just when the album seems like it may settle into some normalcy, this song completely shatters that notion with a nasty, gritty instrumental and yet another powerful vocal performance (this is going to get repetitive, because every vocal performance here is just that amazing). It almost feels like a test for the listener, challenging whether or not they’re capable of following them on their journey through the woods. This is perfectly captured on the instrumental break in the middle of the track, where it seems almost as if S/K themselves are struggling to power through and remain strong enough to maintain their energy and deliver their message. They sound powerful and defeated at the same time, fighting until the very last breath to push back against the oppression they face and lack of resources they have. 
<br>
<br>
“Jumpers”: And here we arrive, at that final breath I referenced in the last track. This is the Sleater-Kinney at their most vulnerable, as well as Sleater-Kinney at their absolute artistic peak. This is, without a shred of doubt, the best Sleater-Kinney track, and to explain why, I really only need to just transcribe the last few lyrics here. But before that, I should touch on the beautifully vivid comparison between Sleater-Kinney and a cloud in California, the sunny golden state. This ties in very well with the next song, but Sleater-Kinney here find themselves completely out of place and are told to be happy in order to fit into the supposed beauty of their surrounding world. I’m from the Bay Area so I’m very much a California boy, but I can’t help but admire their scathing depiction of San Francisco as a city of fake sunshine and beauty, where we all turn away from the jumpers falling from the Golden Gate. And now let’s get to the final lyrics: “My falling shape will draw a line between the flow of sea and sky/I’m not a bird, I’m not a plane/I took a taxi to the gate, I will not go to school again/Four seconds was the longest wait”. Those lyrics send chills up my spine every time I hear them, and I can’t imagine them not bringing tears to your eyes the first time you hear them. This song is incredibly, incredibly powerful, and it’s truly depressing to think of how many people didn’t have the strength to do anything but succumb to society’s oppression and eventually take their lives as a result, which I think is perfectly captured in these last few lines. 
<br>
<br>
“Modern Girl”: This is Sleater-Kinney clawing and fighting out of their grave, revisiting much of what was touched on in the previous track. Lyrically, this somehow manages to be incredibly blunt and open with its message, while not compromising any of the cleverness or beauty that makes for a stellar S/K track. They are clearly fed up with the box they have been placed in, and this song tracks the turn of the album from depression to anger. Sleater-Kinney refuse to die in this box, and this is the precursor to then breaking out in the second half of the album.
<br>
<br>
And that’s the weaker half of the album. Yes, the second half of the album is the stronger half; the next five songs are quite simply the greatest rock songs I have ever heard. The pacing of the album thus far has been admittedly challenging and difficult to follow along with at points thus far, by design. The statement this makes on the difficulty for women to move forward is a potent one, it’s like having to swim through honey when everyone else is swimming through water, and this half perfectly captures that. But from here on out, aside from “Steep Air”, there is nothing but sheer anger and energy ahead, and it all comes together to form one of the most emotionally and viscerally powerful album halves I’ve ever heard.
<br>
<br>
“Entertain”: This kicks off the second half right away with an iconic drum intro, much like “The Fox” did with its guitar screech. The drumming on this song, and this album in general, is absolutely spectacular, and should cement Janet Weiss as one of the greatest drummers in rock history (she is criminally underrated). This entire song is amazing, but there are three lyrics I want to focus on in particular.
<br>
<br>
“You come around sounding 1972/You did nothing new with 1972/Where’s the fuck you?/Where’s the black and blue...” I love how critical this is of the music scene, and holds even more weight today, but that’s not why I’m pointing this out. I may be overreacting, but something critical happens here, Sleater-Kinney swears. The rage is evident here, this is the first (I’m fairly sure) time they’ve sworn on record. They’re no longer holding back, no longer bottling things up, no longer restraining themselves lyrically, vocally, or sonically, this is an explosion of everything that built up in the first half of the album, and this one swear word (as well as the one on “Let’s Call It Love”, but we’ll get there) represents this perfectly. 
<br>
<br>
“All you want is entertainment/Rip me open, it’s freeing”. I absolutely adore the vocal performance on this section of the song, there is so much vitriol here and it adds so much to the lyric itself. This is such a telling line, showing how the music industry takes advantage of artists’ vulnerability for the sake of profit. 
<br>
<br>
“Drag me down, I’m not falling down”. This one is simple, after an entire album half of Sleater-Kinney slowly descending to depression in their box, they break out and refuse to go back in. Again, the vocals here are incredible, and all of the band members’ vocal chemistry is at its peak in this section of the song.
<br>
<br>
“Rollercoaster”: “Sweeeeeet, you’re my tomato!/Reeeed, cherry tomato!” I can’t help but smile and sing along to this line at the top of my lungs every time it plays. The vocal performance here is, dare I say charming and cute, and the band is just having so much fun here. That’s not to say this is a fun song, it’s fun in the same way a beat down roller coaster is: thrilling, but bumpy, scary, and incredibly volatile. This is similar to “Wilderness”, looking at a strained relationship, but here we see Sleater-Kinney taking charge and embracing both their emotional dependence and visceral, superficial enjoyment. They have demands, they’re putting themselves first, and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Stick with me, there’s almost a calculated level of insanity on display here, captured by the laugh at the very end of the track that segues right into “Steep Air”. It’s as if they’re aware of the unhealthiness of this relationship dynamic, which is made clear in the final two tracks. The boldness and selfishness of Sleater-Kinney is to be commended here, but they know the fun they’re experiencing here is fleeting, and that this is no substitute for the love, support, and acceptance they have been searching for throughout their lives.
<br>
<br>
“Steep Air”: “Steep Air” provides a much needed breather after the energy of the preceding two tracks, and is essential in preparing you for the next two. This is the calm before the storm, and the beginning of the end for Sleater-Kinney (before their eventual reunion). Despite the laughs that preceded it at the end of “Rollercoaster”, Sleater-Kinney are still clearly filled with anger, and their words and actions are fueled by an anxiety and sense of urgency, they just cannot last a second longer without acceptance before bursting and taking their anger out on who/whatever is closest. 
<br>
<br>
“Let’s Call It Love” : Unfortunately for Sleater-Kinney, whoever is closest is Sleater-Kinney themselves, and their sheer anger seemingly tore down the band we came to know and love. This is a whopping 11-minute long track, and every minute of it slowly documents Sleater-Kinney falling apart tragically. By this point, the members of Sleater-Kinney are seemingly unable to love, since after all, the only people they’ve really had to love are their other fellow bandmates. With no personal confidants or role models in their families (I know I’m assuming a lot here, this is just my analysis of what’s presented on record, I don’t know what goes on in their personal lives), and a society that teaches them love is following a man blindly and submitting to him for any prospect of emotional or visceral satisfaction, it’s not hard to see how Sleater-Kinney have become angry and bitter, and can’t hold it together long enough to avoid tearing each other apart. In the context of the rest of the album, especially the next track, it’s clear that no one actually dislikes anyone here. This is not some bitter breakup due to different artistic visions, Corin, Carrie, and Janet clearly still love each other. This is simply the fuel finally running out, and each of the band members finally deciding they need to step away from Sleater-Kinney. There’s only so much a band can be ripped apart for entertainment before they fall apart. It sounds as if Sleater-Kinney always had an expiration date, and they finally reached it. They seemingly try to hold in the second half, with a lengthy instrumental section that seems to constantly be avoiding an end until it finally arrives. At some point, the end becomes inevitable, and they break out into “Night Light”
<br>
<br>
“Night Light”: Sleater-Kinney has touched on themes of family before, particularly in “Sympathy” off of One Beat, where Corin describes holding it together for her son. This song extends that past just her son to the general concept of family, and holding it together for those you care about. Of course, family does likely refer to their families, but I think it also refers to each other. Sleater-Kinney is the family here, and they simply can’t carry on supporting each other with the external burden placed upon them. The struggles that they have documented throughout the album have finally piled on and ultimately destroyed Sleater-Kinney, both as individuals, and as a band.
<br>
<br>
There’s a final theme brought up here, and it’s the ultimate nail in the coffin: pride. Sleater-Kinney have always been a very prideful band, it’s a very useful and necessary trait in a cruel, unforgiving, unsupportive music industry, and in a cruel, unforgiving, and unsupportive society. Their pride and candor is often one of their strongest assets in songwriting and performance, but unfortunately makes it difficult for Sleater-Kinney to remain anything but bitter towards each other in light of all they’ve faced. As Corin cries out for help, it seems no one has shown her how to love and support, certainly not through example, but she’s too prideful and bitter to give into asking and accepting her vulnerability and weakness. I love how the song ends in the last minute, it slowly fades into Sleater-Kinney’s dismal fate and perfectly captures the seeming helplessness of the situation they find themselves in. What a perfect ending, to a perfect album.
<br>
<br>
The story of this album is incredible, and the pacing only adds to the storytelling and emotional rollercoaster that this album presents. Through the lyrics, performances, and the grimy production, this album beautifully presents the relationship between depression and anger, and attacks the supposed dichotomy of pride and helplessness. This is one of the most important albums I have ever heard, and I believe everyone should listen to it. So with all of that said, it should be obvious why I think this is Sleater-Kinney’s best work.
